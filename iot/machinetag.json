At one end of the spectrum, an IoT system may not gather data that is sensitive either in terms of safety or privacy, while at the other it may collect data about identifiable individuals or groups of individuals, involve financial transactions, or access to system data or have the ability to control objects that could compromise health, safety or security."

      "description": "A third characteristic of IoT systems concerns the degree of sharing of sensitive data between the object and the system, and subsequently between the system and the system operator(s) or participants, and third parties .Systems do not always need to share data, so IoT product, platform, service and system designers must be clear about when data is shared, what is shared and why."
